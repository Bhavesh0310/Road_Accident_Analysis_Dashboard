# 📊 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard (Excel)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Road Accident Analysis Dashboard** is an interactive data analysis project developed using **Microsoft Excel**.  
The goal of this project is to analyze road accident data and extract meaningful insights related to accident trends, casualty severity, vehicle involvement, road conditions, and time-based patterns.

This dashboard enables users to explore accident data visually and supports data-driven decision-making for improving road safety.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze road accident trends across different time periods  
- Identify high-risk factors contributing to severe accidents  
- Visualize casualties based on vehicle type, road type, and surface condition  
- Compare urban vs rural accident patterns  
- Enable interactive filtering for deeper analysis

---

## 🗂 Dataset Information
The dataset contains detailed records of road accidents, including:
- Accident date and time  
- Accident severity (Fatal, Serious, Slight)  
- Number of casualties  
- Vehicle type involved  
- Road type and road surface condition  
- Area type (Urban / Rural)  
- Light condition (Day / Night)

> The dataset was cleaned and transformed before analysis to ensure accuracy and consistency.
